# synergies

## Project abstract

De Groote et al. (2014) showed that solving the muscle redundancy problem by optimizing performance assuming independent recruitment of muscles in healthy adults resulted in muscle activations that on average could be explained by four muscle synergies1 . Those synergies are similar to the ones derived from measured experimentally using EMG.

Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) however are known to have reduced motor control and use less synergies during walking2,3 . It is unclear if optimizing performance assuming independent recruitment of muscles to solve the redundancy problem in these children will result in similar synergies measured experimentally.

## The goals of this project are:

1. Determine the differences between muscle synergies based on estimated and measured muscle activity during walking in a child with CP.

2. Determine muscle synergies from measured muscle activity for a group of children with CP (8 subjects). Compare them and select 3 relevant subjects for further study (repeat analysis in 1).

3. Determine model sensitivity (marker-based model vs MRI model) towards estimated muscle synergies (subjects depending on available MRI models).

4. If time allows it, determine the differences between estimated and measured muscle synergies during functional movements (squat, sit-to-stand-to-sit and counter movement jump) in a child with CP.
